# Immunefi PoC Templates

This is a collaborative repository that aims to provide reusable and easily modifiable PoC examples for a variety of attacks. This will increase quality of submissions and allow whitehats an easier, faster way to create PoCs and verify their claims.

## Overview

### Installation

A Foundry installation is required to use this repository. See https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.

### Getting Started üìñ

1Ô∏è‚É£ First set up the interfaces for the protocol you will be creating a PoC for. You can create your own interface contracts, or download the contracts for the protocol using Foundry's [`cast etherscan-source`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-etherscan-source) command line tool. Define the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable, then call
```
cast etherscan-source [address] -d src/external
```
This will download the contracts source code to `src/external` where you can simply import any contract interfaces by adding the following to the top of your PoC.
> ##### *üö® When downloading source code from deployed contracts, there may be remappings that need to be modified for the source files to compile. Add any necessary remappings to [`remappings.txt`](./remappings.txt).
```
import "./external/ExampleProtocol/ExampleEtherscanContract.sol"
```
Optionally, append `--chain [chain_name]` to specify a chain other than Ethereum mainnet to download contracts from. **Note:** You will have to update your Etherscan API key when switching between different chains.
<br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Pick a PoC [template](#template-categories-) and modify the template file which extends* from the corresponding source contract. Within the source contract, there will be comments describing how you can modify the PoC to fit your vulnerability. 

> #####  *üö® When extending from an abstract contract, there will be functions which must be defined. Implement any undefined functions with your attack.
<br>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Once you have completed your attack contract, navigate to the corresponding [test](./test) file, import your attack contract, and modify the `setUp()` to replicate any necessary attack preconditions, such as forking from a network, initializing accounts with certain balances, or any other conditions which are necessary for the attack. Try to keep your setup as **close** to mainnet state as possible. The more setup that is done, the harder it is for projects to verify your claims.

### Running a PoC üöÄ

To run a template, run the following in the console:
```
forge test -vv --match-path test/[test_name]
```
