## Overview

Welcome to the Immunefi PoC Templates repository! Here, you'll find reusable and easily modifiable Proof of Concept (PoC) examples for various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based vulnerabilities. Clone the branch corresponding to the chosen [attack template](#template-categories). The aim is to enhance bug reporting quality and provide whitehat hackers with efficient tools to create PoCs and validate their findings quickly. These templates are intended for testing proof of concepts in local forks for submission to bug bounty programs. Any other use is explicitly prohibited.

## Installation

To utilize this repository, you need to have Foundry installed. Check out the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for Foundry.

## Getting Started ðŸ“–

1. **Initialize Forge Repository**: Start by initializing a forge repository with the desired attack template. Use the command below, replacing `[template]` with the chosen template from the [Template Categories](#template-categories):
    ```
    forge init --template immunefi-team/forge-poc-templates --branch [template]
    ```

2. **Download Contract Interfaces**: Obtain contract interfaces either by creating your own or using Foundry's tools:
    - **Create Interface Automatically**: Use Foundry's `cast interface` commandline tool to automatically generate interfaces based on contract ABIs.

    ```
    cast interface [address] -o src/external/interfaces/IExample.sol -n IExample
    ```

    - **Download Entire Source Code**: Alternatively, download entire contract source codes using `cast etherscan-source` command line tool.

    ```
    cast etherscan-source [address] -d src/external
    ```

3. **Write the Test**: Import your attack contract into `PoCTest.sol` and modify the `setUp()` function to replicate necessary attack preconditions. Execute the attack in the `testAttack()` function.

    The test should extend the `PoC` contract, which introduces functionality to automatically snapshot and print account balances before and after a test.
    
    Use the modifier `snapshot(address account, IERC20[] tokens)` on the `test*` function to automatically print information such as pre-attack balances, post-attack balances, and profit. Passing a token with address(0x0) corresponds to the native token of the chain.

## Running a PoC ðŸš€

To run a test, execute the following command in the console:
```
forge test -vv --match-path test/[test_name]
```
